          Travel site TripAdvisor has waded into hotly contested territory with
          a list of the best BBQ restaurants in the United States.
          <br />
          Not a one of the top 10 restaurants is in Tennessee, North Carolina or
          South Carolina. Blasphemy? Maybe. But hold on to your judgments;
          TripAdvisor also ranked the top 10 states for BBQ and all three of
          those smoking barbecue states make that list. <br /><br />
          The review site created its top 10 list for restaurants by looking at
          barbecue joints with a minimum of 100 reviews and ranked them based on
          the volume and quality of reviews. More weight was given to reviews
          written within the past year, and chains with more than 10 locations
          were excluded.

          Though recent vacation photos show Barack Obama basking in the warm
          sun of retirement, while jet-skiing away any political worries, his
          former staffer alludes to a second act. "He'll (Obama) be back but if
          there was anyone who deserved a vacation, it was those two," says
          Alyssa Mastromonaco, referring to the now-former President and his
          wife, former first lady Michelle Obama. "He's living his best life."
          Currently the chief operating officer of Vice Media, Mastromonaco
          served as Obama's White House deputy chief of staff for operations
          from 2011 through 2014. However, her ties to the nation's 44th
          President go back much further, as she first worked for Obama during
          his days as an Illinois state senator.<br />
          he FBI gathered intelligence last summer that suggests Russian
          operatives tried to use Trump advisers, including Carter Page, to
          infiltrate the Trump campaign, according to US officials.

          <div class="about">
            <div class="aboutWord">
              Stephanie was born and raised in Southern California. At a young
              age she enjoyed helping mom with dinner and scooping ice cream at
              the family’s Baskin Robbins, but it was her 4 years living in San
              Francisco as a collegiate Conservatory of Music student that
              cemented her love of all things food and cooking. Eventually
              cooking took center stage, so Stephanie packed up her instruments
              and enrolled in the California Culinary Academy in San
              Francisco.<br />
              After culinary school, Stephanie moved to Los Angeles and cooked
              for James Beard award-winning chef Suzanne Goin for 5 1/2 years,
              the last two of which were spent as Sous Chef at AOC restaurant.
              She also ran AOC’s cheese program during this time.<br />
              Shortly after leaving her sous chef post, Elizabeth approached
              Stephanie with an idea for a catering business.<br />
            </div>
            <div class="aboutWord">
              Elizabeth’s culinary career started in an unlikely spot: a flower
              shop. It was her job to create the floral designs for wedding
              cakes– a job that inevitably led to her tasting a great deal of
              cake, and finding most of it to be entirely mediocre.<br />
              She figured there must be a market for brides who want more from
              their wedding cakes than just looking great. So with visions of
              buttercream and chocolate dancing in her head, she headed off to
              culinary school at Johnson & Wales in Denver, Colorado.<br />
              After culinary school, Elizabeth moved back home to Southern
              California, where she worked at a variety of bakeries and
              restaurants, including AOC, where she met Stephanie. They
              instantly bonded over their love of farmers market food, and all
              things cheese.<br />
